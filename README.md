2. During the presentation, the speaker can ask the public to answer a poll question
3. Contrary, the public can ask open questions to the speaker using his smartphone or any networked device
4. Everything is monitored by the moderator, who can pre-select open or poll questions, send them to the speaker's screen, and archive them once they have been answered
