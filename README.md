# Survey
An application you can use during a stage presentation

## Features
This application has 3 types of user :
* A public user (aka the audience)
* A moderator (usually in backstage, monitoring)
* The speaker

Each user has his own dedicated screen

## How to use
1. Previous to the presentation, the administrator prepares the speaker's poll questions
2. During the presentation, the speaker can ask the public to answer a poll question. The public can answer using his smartphone or any networked device
3. A bar chart is displayed in real time on the speaker's screen with the public answers along with the percentage of users who answered the question
3. On the contrary, the public can ask open questions to the speaker using his smartphone
4. Everything is monitored by the moderator, who can see the list of all the questions (poll or from the audience), pre-select them, send them to the speaker's screen, and archive them once they have been answered
5. Obviously, everything works in real time !
